<h3>Accessible Form UI</h3>

<p>Goal of the project is creating an accessible form UI using HTML and CSS.</p>

<h4>Requirements</h4>
1- Form needs to inlcude a fullname, email, password and confirm password and a button.</br>
2- Form won’t be functional, it will be a static UI component that can be enhanced with JavaScript in the future. </br>
3- Accesibility Guidelines should be followed.

<h4>Accesibility Guidelines</h4>
<p><b>Labeling:</b> Ensure that each form field has a corresponding <label> element that is clearly associated with the field using the for attribute.</p></br>
<p><b>Focus State:</b> Style the focus state of each input field so that users navigating with a keyboard can easily see which field is currently active.</p></br>
<p><b>Error Messaging:</b> Consider adding space for error messages that can be displayed when a user inputs invalid data. These messages should be clearly associated with the relevant input field.</p></br>
<p><b>ARIA Attributes:</b> Use ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes where necessary, such as aria-required for required fields and aria-invalid for fields with errors.</p></br>
<p><b>Color Contrast:</b> Ensure that the color contrast between text and background is sufficient to meet WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) standards, making the form readable for users with visual impairments.</p></br>
<p><b>Interactive Elements:</b> Make sure that the button to show/hide the password is accessible via keyboard and screen readers, providing clear feedback on the current state (e.g., “Password is hidden” or “Password is visible”).</p></br>
