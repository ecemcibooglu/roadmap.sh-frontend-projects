<h3>Tooltip UI</h3>

<p>The goal of the project is creating a tooltip that appears above navigation items when hovered, using only HTML and CSS.</p>
<p>A tooltip is a small pop-up box that provides additional information about a navigation item when a user hovers over it. This project will focus on mastering CSS positioning, hover effects, and creating visually appealing tooltips without relying on JavaScript.</p>
